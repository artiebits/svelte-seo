### Open Graph

Svelte SEO supports the following Open Graph object types: basic, music, movie, article, book, and profile. For the full specification, please check out http://ogp.me/.

### Twitter

Svelte SEO supports all Twitter Card Tags. For more information, check out the Twitter documentation at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/markup.

```svelte
twitter={{
  card: 'summary_large_image',
  site: '@primalmovement',
  title: 'Primal Movement | Natural Movement for Better Health',
  description: 'Learn about primal movement exercises and how they can benefit your fitness.',
  image: 'https://www.primal-movement.com/images/squatting.jpg',
  imageAlt: 'Squatting'
}}
```

### Facebook

```svelte
facebook={{
  appId: '1234567890'
}}
```

### JSON-LD

JSON-LD provides a more customizable and detailed representation of content in search results. With Svelte SEO, you can implement all available JSON-LD types. Here is a basic example:

```svelte
jsonLd={{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "name": "Primal Movement | Natural Movement for Better Health",
  "description": "Learn about primal movement exercises and how they can benefit your fitness.",
  "url": "https://www.primal-movement.com"
}}
```

## Setting Default SEO Properties

You can set default SEO properties that will appear on every page without needing to add them individually. Common meta tags like `theme-color`, `manifest`, and `base` can be present on every page. If you configure the Svelte SEO in your `+layout.svelte`, these properties will stay fixed for every page. They can be changed on a per-page basis if necessary. For more information on using layouts and routing with SvelteKit, please refer to the official documentation at https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#layout.
